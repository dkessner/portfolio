# Open Educational Resources for Teachers

The open source movement in software has inspired similar movements that
promote open educational resources and open public data.  In our Computer
Science program at Marlborough we rely exclusively on open software and
textbooks. I will share with you some of my favorite open resources, including
open access textbooks, publicly available datasets, and open source software.
Note: This is not limited to computer science!  Open textbooks are available in
all subject areas, and there are many public domain works and public data sets
that are useful for humanities and social science classes.
