Building a Fun and Exciting Computer Science Curriculum

Five years ago we started a new computer science program at Marlborough School
with the first introductory coding class. Since then we have grown the program
to include middle school electives, advanced courses, and coding in various
math and science classes. We now have students who have been studying computer
science for 3 or more years, and are working on projects involving data
analysis and interpretation, microcontrollers and sensors, 3D computer
graphics, virtual reality, and interactive music visualizations and
projections. In this session, I will show how the combination of a vibrant
academic culture, strong support from the administration, emphasis on
student-directed creative projects, and open source software has led to a fun
and exciting computer science curriculum.
