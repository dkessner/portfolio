Graphics programming in Java with the Processing software libraries

The Processing open-source programming language and software libraries were
developed at the MIT Media Lab both as an educational tool and as a tool for
visual artists to express themselves in code.  The Processing software
libraries are written in Java, and can be easily used directly from Java
programs.  Processing provides a particularly simple application model, which
makes it easy for the programmer to create interactive computer graphics
programs.

In this workshop, aimed at teachers of AP Computer Science or more advanced
courses, participants will learn how to use the Processing libraries from Java.
I will present several examples of how interactive computer graphics programs
are an ideal way to illustrate fundamental concepts in computer science and
object-oriented programming.

Participants should have their own laptops.  Before the workshop, participants
should download and install:

1) Processing Development Environment which is free and available for all
platforms (Windows, OSX, Linux).  
http://processing.org/ 

2) Java SE Development Kit 8 (JDK 8).  (Note: newer versions of Java are
not yet compatible with Processing).

3) Any text editor.  Atom is a good one:
