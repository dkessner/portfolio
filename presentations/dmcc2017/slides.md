## LED Hat

<img src="pix/hat.jpg" width="50%" style="float: left; margin-right: 60px;">


* 150 NeoPixels (individually addressable RGB LEDs), controlled by Flora
    (Arduino-compatible) micro-controller.

* Raspberry Pi connected to Flora (USB serial connection).

* Web page on Raspberry Pi calls CGI script (Python) when the form is submitted, 
    which sends message to the Flora via the serial connection.
