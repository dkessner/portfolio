I teach math and computer science at Marlborough School, an independent girls
school in Los Angeles.  My daily work depends heavily on many free and open
source projects.

In the classroom I use free and open source software, open public data, and
open educational resources.  You can find out more about these resources on my
[Teacher Resources](https://dkessner.github.io/TeacherResources/)
page.  

This website was created with 
<a href="https://simplecss.org/">Simple.css</a>

I created the animation with <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>.
