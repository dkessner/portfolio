    <h1>Why Girls Still Need To Code</h1>

    <p>
    In her 2018 research, Joy Buolamwini demonstrated that commercial facial
    recognition software from major tech companies was much more successful at
    identifying white male faces than brown or female faces
    <a href="http://gendershades.org/" target=_blank>[1]</a>.

    In a more recent study on the faces of U.S. members of Congress, men were
    tagged with labels such as "official" and "businessperson", while the most
    common labels associated with female faces included "smile" and "hairstyle"
    <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2378023120967171" target="_blank">[2]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    There is no doubt that the engineers, project managers, and chief executives of
    the companies involved in these projects were hard working and had no ill
    intentions. How is it possible that these companies have released software that
    produces biased output?
    </p>

    <p>
    The answer is clear: there has been a historic lack of diversity of voices in
    the development of these software projects, from research to development to
    testing to public release.  If the CEO of one of these companies were a Black
    woman, it would be highly unlikely for the company to release facial
    recognition software that did not recognize her face.
    </p>

    <p>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) powers a huge amount of software, for example
    facial recognition, entertainment recommendation, targeted ads, fraud
    detection, risk assessment, language translation, and voice assistants.
    Software engineers train AI software algorithms with data sets, and lack of
    diversity in the data can lead to bias in the algorithms.  In addition, any
    patterns in the data caused by historic inequities will be perpetuated if the
    algorithm is used for prediction or recommendation.
    </p>

    <p>
    Biased software is a problem for two reasons: 1) people from underrepresented
    groups may have less access to important services, and 2) policy relying on
    such software are likely to perpetuate any patterns of historic inequity.

    The Computer Science curriculum at Marlborough has grown over the past 6 years
    under the principles of open access and the promotion of diversity.  First of
    all, there is no bar to entry: our introductory coding classes have no
    prerequisites, and we welcome all students.
    </p>

    <p>
    We use open source software and open access educational resources for our
    computer science classes.  All of our classes are project-based and students
    are given the support and opportunity they need to master the skills required
    to create software.  In addition, we encourage civic engagement through the
    analysis of publicly available data sets, both in coding classes and for
    research projects.  
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, we encourage our students to explore applications of software in a
    wide variety of areas, such as math and science, humanities and social
    sciences, and the visual and performing arts.
    <a href="http://stem.marlborough.org/blog/csprojects2020" target="_blank">Our coding students create</a>
    websites, video games, interactive data visualizations, mobile apps, wearable
    electronics, robots, generative visual art, and video projections for dance
    performances.  
    </p>

    <p>
    Our future will be determined by who creates software and
    how that software is used.  The goal of our Computer Science curriculum at
    Marlborough is to promote a future where diverse teams of people ensure that
    the software we are creating is unbiased, and where diverse teams of people
    make decisions about how we use that software in our society.
