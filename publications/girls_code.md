In her 2018 research, Joy Buolamwini demonstrated that commercial facial
recognition software from major tech companies was much more successful at
identifying white male faces than brown or female faces
([1](http://gendershades.org/)).
In a more recent study on the faces of U.S. members of Congress, men were
tagged with labels such as "official" and "businessperson", while the most
common labels associated with female faces included "smile" and "hairstyle"
([2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2378023120967171)). 

There is no doubt that the engineers, project managers, and chief executives of
the companies involved in these projects were hard working and had no ill
intentions. How is it possible that these companies have released software that
produces biased output?

The answer is clear: there has been a historic lack of diversity of voices in
the development of these software projects, from research to development to
testing to public release.  If the CEO of one of these companies were a Black
woman, it would be highly unlikely for the company to release facial
recognition software that did not recognize her face.

Artificial intelligence (AI) powers a huge amount of software, for example
facial recognition, entertainment recommendation, targeted ads, fraud
detection, risk assessment, language translation, and voice assistants.
Software engineers train AI software algorithms with data sets, and lack of
diversity in the data can lead to bias in the algorithms.  In addition, any
patterns in the data caused by historic inequities will be perpetuated if the
algorithm is used for prediction or recommendation.

Biased software is a problem for two reasons: 1) people from underrepresented
groups may have less access to important services, and 2) policy relying on
such software are likely to perpetuate any patterns of historic inequity.

The Computer Science curriculum at Marlborough has grown over the past 6 years
under the principles of open access and the promotion of diversity.  First of
all, there is no bar to entry: our introductory coding classes have no
prerequisites, and we welcome all students.

We use open source software and open access educational resources for our
computer science classes.  All of our classes are project-based and students
are given the support and opportunity they need to master the skills required
to create software.  In addition, we encourage civic engagement through the
analysis of publicly available data sets, both in coding classes and for
research projects.  

Finally, we encourage our students to explore applications of software in a
wide variety of areas, such as math and science, humanities and social
sciences, and the visual and performing arts.
[Our coding students create](http://stem.marlborough.org/blog/csprojects2020)
websites, video games, interactive data visualizations, mobile apps, wearable
electronics, robots, generative visual art, and video projections for dance
performances.  

Our future will be determined by who creates software and
how that software is used.  The goal of our Computer Science curriculum at
Marlborough is to promote a future where diverse teams of people ensure that
the software we are creating is unbiased, and where diverse teams of people
make decisions about how we use that software in our society.
