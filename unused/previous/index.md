I serve as Program Head of 
[Computer Science and Software Innovation](http://stem.marlborough.org) 
at [Marlborough School](http://marlborough.org) 
in Los Angeles.  I develop the computer science curriculum, and I work with
faculty in various departments (e.g. Math, Science, Visual Arts, Performing
Arts, Social Sciences, Social Justice) to integrate computational thinking
and coding into the curriculum. I supervise students in research and
interdisciplinary projects involving computer science and engineering.  

I also develop bioinformatics software for cancer research at the [Ellison
Medical Institute](https://emila.org/).  I am currently working on software related to:
DNA sequencing, mass spectrometry for proteomics and metabolomics, AI image
analysis for drug discovery, clinical databases, and data analysis pipelines.

I have taught at the secondary and college levels, and have written software
for over 25 years in various fields, including computer security, computer
graphics, and computational biology. 

I am a strong proponent of free and open source software, open public data, and
open educational resources.  I am also an advocate for increasing the diversity
of voices in the STEM fields in general, and in software development in
particular.
